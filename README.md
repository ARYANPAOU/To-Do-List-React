# To-Do-List-React

This To-Do List app is a sleek and minimal web application built using React.js, HTML, and CSS. Designed for simplicity and ease of use, it allows users to manage their daily tasks with an elegant and intuitive interface. Users can add new tasks quickly through a streamlined input field, remove them with a single click, and rearrange them in order of priority using up and down controls. The styling is clean and modern, featuring soft shadows, smooth animations, and a balanced, neutral color palette that keeps the focus on the content.
